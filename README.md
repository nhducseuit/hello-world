# hello-world

Hi World there,

My name is Duc. I graduated from UIT and now working as Development. But after 3 years I still feel like I'm just a Coder. So I start researching new technique to improve myself. First step I took is to make my own GitHub account. So, nice to meet you and please be nice with me :)
